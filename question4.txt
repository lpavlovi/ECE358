The bounded queue simulator is built on top of the first implementation. The parameters for the buffer bound are included in the initialized phase. The code includes a few if statements to modify the behaviour if K has a value. By default K is set to None (the null value in python) and would execute identically to the first simulator with an unbounded buffer. If K is set to an integer value then the arrival method does a check to compare the size of the buffer to the value of K. If the buffer capcity is equal to K then the packet is dropped and a new metric is recorded. At the end of the run method, a the packet loss metric is introduced only if K has an integer value. Just as before, the run method outputs all of the recorded metrics which are then used by the simulation runner to obtain the averages over 5.
